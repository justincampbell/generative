## Installation

### Add Generative to your Gemfile (or gemspec):

```rb
group :test do
  gem 'generative'
  gem 'rspec'
end
```

...and then run `bundle`.

### Require Generative in your `.rspec` file:

```
--color
--format progress
--require generative
```

### (Optional) Require the Generative Rake task in your `Rakefile`:

```rb
require 'rspec/core/rake_task'
require 'generative/rake_task'

task(:default).enhance [:spec, :generative]

RSpec::Core::RakeTask.new
Generative::RakeTask.new
```

### Remove any random/other ordering

If using RSpec 2, you'll need to make sure you remove `config.order =
'random'`, or any other ordering strategies, from your spec helper. You can
also use `Generative.running?` to only disable random ordering during
Generative runs:

```rb
config.order = :random unless Generative.running?
```

In RSpec 3, this is not necessary, because each example group (the `generative`
block) can override ordering for that group.

## Usage

### Specs

In your tests, add a `generative` block. This is a essentially the same as a
`context` or `describe` block. Inside the block, define some `data` as you
would a `let`. Then, write your `it`/`specify` blocks as usual (while keeping
in mind that the input could be anything).

```rb
describe String do
  let(:string) { "abc" }

  describe "#reverse" do
    it "reverses" do
      expect(string.reverse).to eq("cba")
    end

    generative do
      data(:string) { rand(12345).to_s }

      it "maintains length" do
        expect(string.reverse.length).to eq(string.length)
      end

      it "is not destructive" do
        expect(string.reverse.reverse).to eq(string)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### Running

Generative comes with a `generative` command, which simply runs rspec with the
required arguments:

```
$ generative
+ GENERATIVE_COUNT=10_000
+ rspec --require generative --format Generative --tag generative
Run options: include {:generative=>true}

String
  #length
    generative
      is never negative
  #reverse
    generative
      maintains length
      is not destructive

Finished in 2.28 seconds
30000 examples, 0 failures
```

If you've added the Generative task to your `Rakefile`, you can also simply run
`rake ` to run all tests, including Generative ones.

### Number of Tests

Generative uses the `GENERATIVE_COUNT` environment variable to control how many
tests to run for each example. Both the `generative` command and the example
`Rakefile` above set it to 10,000.

### Formatters

Given the examples above, running `rspec` will use the default "progress"
formatter. Requiring generative will modify this formatter to output blue dots
instead of green for generative tests. Generative also includes it's own
formatter, which will only display generative test names once, also in blue.
